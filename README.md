  In OOP, program is divided into parts called objects.
  
Importance      
    In POP,Importance is not given to data but to functions as well as sequence of actions to be done.	
    In OOP, Importance is given to the data rather than procedures or functions because it works as a real world

Expansion
  To add new data and function in POP is not so easy.
  OOP provides an easy way to add new data and function.
  
Data Access
  In POP, Most function uses Global data for sharing that can be accessed freely from function to function in the system.
  In OOP, data can not move easily from function to function,it can be kept public or private so we can control the access of data.
  
Data Hiding
  POP does not have any proper way for hiding data so it is less secure.
  OOP provides Data Hiding so provides more security.
  
Overloading
  In POP, Overloading is not possible.
  In OOP, overloading is possible in the form of Function Overloading and Operator Overloading.
  
Examples
