Demanstration of POP and OOP
                  Procedure Oriented Programming                              Object Oriented Programming
                  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
Divided Into    In POP, program is divided into small parts                 In OOP, program is divided into parts called objects.
                called functions.
                
Importance      In POP,Importance is not given to data but to               In OOP, Importance is given to the data rather than procedures 
                                                                             or functions because it works as a real world.
                functions as well as sequence of 
                actions to be done.	
                
                
Approach      POP follows Top Down approach.                              OOP follows Bottom Up approach.

Access        POP does not have any access specifier                      OOP has access specifiers named Public, Private, Protected, etc.
Specifiers

Data Moving   
  In POP, Data can move freely from function to function in the system.
  In OOP, objects can move and communicate with each other through member functions.
  
Expansion
  To add new data and function in POP is not so easy.
  OOP provides an easy way to add new data and function.
  
Data Access
  In POP, Most function uses Global data for sharing that can be accessed freely from function to function in the system.
  In OOP, data can not move easily from function to function,it can be kept public or private so we can control the access of data.
  
Data Hiding
  POP does not have any proper way for hiding data so it is less secure.
  OOP provides Data Hiding so provides more security.
  
Overloading
  In POP, Overloading is not possible.
  In OOP, overloading is possible in the form of Function Overloading and Operator Overloading.
  
Examples
  Example of POP are : C, VB, FORTRAN, Pascal.
  Example of OOP are : C++, JAVA, VB.NET, C#.NET.
